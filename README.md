Gallery using API

1. On window load, the pre-set url request is sent to Flickr. 
2. After load has been completed and the loading icon has disappeared, the user is then able to view the images that have been loaded.
3. Click an image and navigate through either by clicking the arrows or using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
4. Close the modal either but clicking on the 'x' or hitting the 'esc' key on your keyboard.
5. Enter a new item to search for in the input field. If you misspell your query, hit refresh to reload page and wait for the preset query to be finished loading before retrying your search.
